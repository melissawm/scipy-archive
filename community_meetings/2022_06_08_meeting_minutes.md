    - If you need a passcode for zoom, `scipy` should work.

**Present:** Melissa (@melissawm), Tyler, Pamphile (@tupui), Maureen

## Agenda

- [name=Pamphile] Decision: NumPy imports in doctests [PR 13049](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/13049)
    - Pamphile will send a message to the mailing list
    - We'll probably rediscuss at the next meeting (June 22)
- [name=Pamphile] Grants update:
    - CZI submitted.
    - Small Development Grant (SDG), NumFOCUS, submitted: Faster Random Variate Sampling from SciPy Statistical Distributions.
    - SDG, awarded: Introducing Users to Powerful New Features of SciPy
    - NASA grant: still no updates
- [name=Melissa] Wiki update
    - New malicious edits
        - Example: https://github.com/scipy/scipy/wiki/_compare/5fd347b432131deeb4efec79b3414ff08a4dabc7
    - No moderation options except to restrict all or open all
    - [Pandas moving away from it](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/47277), [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/wiki/_compare/71ab82ef5070770e09073ecbae814968ef4af50a) may also be.
    - One option would be to remove all but the release notes from the SciPy wiki. Other options include moving away from it completely and using the github web interface, but it may not be as straightforward.
    - Melissa to go through the documents at the wiki and send a message with a request for comments on the mailing list.
- [name=Melissa] Slack
    - How do we want to invite people? 
    - Pamphile suggests using a google form with an invite link at the end.

- [name=Melissa] Create a screenshare of a PR review (from [Newcomer meeting](https://hackmd.io/@melissawm/scipy-newcomers))
